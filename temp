Good points:
Normalise difficult scientific ideas so that they could be approachable for everybody

Interesting : $40-50 per article, the $20 per month subscription on Outread allows unlimited access to research summaries, which is more affordable,

Questions/improvements:

Customise the dashboard for each person. Nobody’s interested in every topic, it could be more convenient if the products could just show related articles. Like job boards, they will need us to input preference, skills, expertise, so that they can show the right jobs to the right people.
For me, I would really want to know if articles are legit, justified and respected. Find ways to show how famous this article is by displaying the author name maybe ? citations and reference or university ? Link to original articles 
Currently, I am a research assistant. I feel it’s pretty hard to review, justify the correctness of the articles ? how about introducing an AI to help as a peer developer to help people read and justify articles. The AI can help to answer all questions related to the topic, giving ideas directions to researchers ? The right directions at the right  time could save a lot of time.
Under topic, I think it could be better if there are tags, by this way, it could be easier to choose what to read. Could be handful for user to search for articles as well
